// Package cgot is a helper for testing the target C-code.
// Each C function gets a Go wrapper which is tested in appropriate test functions.
// For some reason inside the tip_test.go an 'import "C"' is not possible.
// The C-files referring to the trice sources this way avoiding code duplication.
// The Go functions defined here are not exported. They are called by the Go test functions in this package.
// This way the test functions are executing the trice C-code compiled with the triceConfig.h here.
// Inside ./testdata this file is named cgoPackage.go where it is maintained.
// The ../renewIDs_in_examples_and_test_folder.sh script copies this file under the name generated_cgoPackage.go into various
// package folders, where it is used separately.
